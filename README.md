# KoCL
Simple OpenCL Wrapper for Java/Kotlin with minimum overhead


## Why?
While learning and exploring OpenCL (for Java development) i found myself in the uncomfortable situation:

**There are simply no examples or tutorials from which i can learn more about this wonderful API**

And this is primarily the main issue why a lot of people getting overwhelmed by the complexity of API, and burn out from this.

Which is why i decided to create this lib, so you don't have to worry about bunch of tricky moments and nuances of OpenCL, while maintaining similarity of OpenCL coding approach.

## Structure
Here you can find lib itself, as well as example of usage

## Warning
OpenCL 1.1/1.2's events are not supported. I will bring this feature in future.
